# Coding-Quiz-Challenge
This is challenge #4 in the Coding Bootcamp course

Project is not completed yet. I went down a rabbit-hole of returning an array of elements but I don't think that will work. I think a better bet is to store the question number in a data attribute and use that value to turn sections on and off. Event delegation will tell me which item was clicked and I can get info from that.

UPDATE 12/12/23 8:36AM: I believe the quiz now works correctly. Now I need to set up the timer, calculate the score, and then set up the high scores.
