There are a series of (currently five) questions. This is a timed quiz, answering quickly is good: your score when you finish all the questions is the amount of time remaining on the clock. But if you answer incorrectly, 10 seconds are deducted from the timer!

The timer starts when you click the "Start Quiz" button.

## Planned Future Enhancements

- randomize the questions and answers so the quizzes will not be identical
- larger testbank of questions
- user selection of the quiz length (number of questions)
- display of time/dates with the high scores
- allow user to quit during the quiz
- if user's score is zero, don't prompt them for initials
